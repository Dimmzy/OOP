# Intro to Java Project
An arkanoid based game written in Java.  
Uses GUI packages to draw the geometry and parsing logic on library files for addition pictures/artwork.  
Parses complemented text files for level design and information.  
Uses several design patterns, most notebly observer/listener for collision between moving objects.  
The last assignment converts existing code into a space-invaders game with similar logic to the original game with some twists and custom sprites.  
Running the JARs requries the biuoop-1.4.jar package which consists the GUI drawing methods (that are based on the built in Java packages)
