# Intro to Java Project
An arkanoid based game written in Java.  
Uses GUI packages (based on the standard Java packages) to draw the geometry and parsing logic on library files for addition pictures/artwork.  
Parses complemented text files for level design and information.  
Uses several design patterns, most notebly observer/listener for collision between moving objects.  
The last assignment converts existing code into a space-invaders game with similar logic to the original game with some twists and custom sprites.
